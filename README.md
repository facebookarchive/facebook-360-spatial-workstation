# Important Deprecation Notice
Due to the abundance of quality tools for creating 3D immersive, spatial audio, today (March 11, 2022) weâ€™re announcing that Meta is ending our support of Audio360 suite on May 16, 2022. We provided the suite for free to ensure that content creators had excellent and easy-to-use authoring tools at a time when such tools were a rarity, and this need is now abundantly served. After May 16, 2022, the suite will no longer be available for download, and our direct support of the suite will end. However, the team will continue supporting external downloads of the Audio360 Encoder application, available on Windows and macOS for the foreseeable future.

# Facebook 360 Spatial Workstation
The [Facebook 360 Spatial Workstation](https://facebook360.fb.com/spatial-workstation/) is  a software suite for designing spatial audio for 360 video and cinematic VR. It includes plugins for popular audio workstations, a time synchronized 360 video player and utilities to help design and publish spatial audio in a variety of formats. Audio produced with the tools can be experienced on Facebook News Feed on Android and iOS devices, Chrome for desktop and the Samsung Gear VR headset through headphones.
